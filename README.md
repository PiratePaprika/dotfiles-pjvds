# Keyboard

My daily driver is a Planck - High Profile with Gateron Silent Clear (Linear | 4.0mm travel | 35g Actuation). It's a 40% ortholiniar keyboard that allows me to move keys towards my fingers with layer keys instead of moving my fingers to the keys. With my current setup a finger never has to travel more than one key in any direction.
