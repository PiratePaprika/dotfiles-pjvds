# dotfiles

The base of my development environment is Ubuntu with the tilling window manager i3. Most applications are configured with a dark theme called monokai.

### i3

Tilling window manager that rocks!

### i3status

A utility that is used to generate the i3 status bar at the bottom of the screen.

### dmenu

A utility to launch apps from the i3 desktop. [command]+[d] is bound to start it.

### terminator

Terminal emulator with the styling support I need and extra features like the ability to follow links.

### zsh

A modern shell most closely resembles Korn shell. Despite being over 20 years old it is considered _new_. Famous for command completion, path expansion and replacement. It is a Bash drop in replacement and with `oh-my-zsh` is becomes 10x.

### sqlite

Self contained database. Used for multiple auto-complete scenario's in zsh, for example, completing dnf install arguments.

### z

Utility to jump to directies. It records all your directory changes and lets you jump to them. For example, `z code` will jump to `/home/pjvds/Code`.

### oh-my-zsh

Turns the already great zsh shell into an 10x environment.

### vim

How to quit this editor?

### spacevim

A popular community-driven vim distribution.

### reflex

Utility to watch file changes.
