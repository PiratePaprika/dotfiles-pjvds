# dotfiles

This repostory contains 10 years of dotfile history with various configurations. Currently I'm running Arch Linux with the tilling window manager bspwm. Most applications are configured with a dark theme called monokai in combination with the purple tints of the dracula theme.

## Features

### Qutebrowser profiles

Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd> to launch the qutebrowser profile picker. This allows you to pick a profile for the browser, comparable to Firefox Containers but at window level instead of tabs.

Profiles are identified by different border colors. Here is an example of 3 browser instances each running a different profile identified by a per profile border color.

# Keyboard

My daily driver is a 40% ortholiniar keyboard that allows me to move keys towards my fingers, instead of moving my fingers to the keys. With this keyboard I never have to travel more than a single key in any direction.
